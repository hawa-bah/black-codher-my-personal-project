### Clone Repo

1. Go to your forked repo
2. Click Code
3. Click HTTPS
4. Copy the text starting with `https://github.com/<your-repo-name>/black-codher-personal-project` (replace <your-repo-name> with the name of your GitHub username)
5. On your command line / terminal type `git clone https://github.com/<your-repo-name>/black-codher-personal-project` (replace <your-repo-name> with the name of your GitHub username)

### Populate The Database

You need to create and populate an initial collection in your local MongoDB server:

1. Type `cd black-codher-personal-project` to navigate to your project root directory
2. Type `mongo` to open a MongoDB shell
3. Type `use black-codher-personal-project` to create your database
4. Type `exit` to close the shell
5. Type `mongoimport -h 127.0.0.1:27017 -d black-codher-personal-project -c users --file ./server/models/data.json --jsonArray` _Make sure this command is run from your project's root directory!_

### Start The Development Server

You can start the client side code (front-end), server side (back-end) and database separately using the commands in their respective folders. If you prefer to start all three together (this is the most convienient way), you can do so with the following commands:

1. `npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..`
2. `npm run develop`

Please note that you run `npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..` during your first installation, subsequently you will only need to run `npm run develop` to get your development environment up and running

### Example Application

We have created an example application that will display a list of users that are stored in your local database.

If all's well with the above steps, you should see a list of names. If your browser shows a "No users found" message, re-check all the steps to ensure your database is populated and connected properly.
